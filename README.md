# Lab 1 - *Tumblr*

**Tumblr** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

The following **optional** user stories are implemented:

- [x] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [x] User can "Pull to refresh" the image list

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. It was very helpful to first do the assignment, then use the skills learned to do the lab. Rushing to do the lab first was a misconception my class believed would help with the team work of this week's curriculum.
2. I enjoyed being able to add the launch image in the week 1 assignment. I would like to discuss more about adding asset images to projects.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I would sometimes lose a link between the image layout feature and the code. I became acutely aware of how important it is to maintain links between the layout and code.

1. I would very much learn how to detect if a link between a story board item and a swift file has been lost.
2. I would also like to learn more about common Swift syntax norms.

## Notes

Configuring the date format properly was definitely a challenge for this lab project. There are so many formatting options!
